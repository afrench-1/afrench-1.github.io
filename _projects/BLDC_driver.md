## PCB Electronics Project Overview

In this project, I designed and developed a custom printed circuit board (PCB) for a [specific function like power management, signal processing, etc.]. The aim was to create a high-performance, compact, and reliable PCB for use in various electronic applications.

The project involved schematic design, component selection, PCB layout, prototyping, and testing. Below are the highlights of the process with images showcasing each step.

### Design Process

I started with the schematic design using software such as KiCad, Altium, or Eagle. Component selection was critical to ensure the best performance while minimizing space and cost. After finalizing the design, I laid out the PCB tracks and performed design rule checks to make sure there were no errors before manufacturing.

### Testing and Results

After assembling the PCB, I conducted several tests to ensure the board was functioning correctly. I used [testing methods, e.g., multimeter for continuity tests, oscilloscope for signal integrity, etc.].
