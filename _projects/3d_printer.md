Building your own custom 3D printer is both a rewarding and challenging experience. In this guide, we’ll walk through the critical steps involved in the process—from designing the frame to calibrating the printer and achieving high-quality prints.

Let’s begin by looking at the structure and components that make this custom build unique.

# Custom 3D Printer Build

Welcome to the build log of our **Custom 3D Printer**. This project involved creating a 3D printer from scratch with a focus on flexibility, precision, and the ability to handle various filament types. Whether you're looking to build your own 3D printer or just curious about the process, this guide covers the critical stages from frame design to calibration and the first print.

## Project Overview

This custom printer was designed to be:
- **Scalable** for larger build volumes
- **Modular**, allowing future upgrades
- **Precise**, suitable for both flexible and high-temperature filaments

### Key Features:
- **Direct-drive extruder** for flexibility
- **All-metal hotend** for high-temp materials like ABS and Nylon
- **Raspberry Pi** controller with **Marlin firmware**
- **Bed leveling sensor** for automatic calibration

## 1. Frame Design and Assembly

The frame is constructed using **aluminum extrusions**, providing a lightweight and rigid structure essential for accurate printing. The modular nature of the frame allows for easy expansion if a larger build area is required in the future.
